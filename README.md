# Alx Fix My Code challenge

## Context

The Aim of this Project is to build troubleshooting skills even in languages I haven't used yet.

Existing codebases with seemingly disguised errors are presented for analysis.

Nothing is coded from scratch, just changes ranging from subtle to more significant corrections are made to the existing codebase.
