# Alx Fix My Code challenge

## Context

The Aim of this Project is to build troubleshooting skills even in languages I haven't used yet.

Existing codebases with seemingly disguised errors are presented for analysis.

Nothing is coded from scratch, just subtle changes or more significant corrections to the codebase.
